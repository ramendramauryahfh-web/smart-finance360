              <h1>iQOO 15 Launch: Full Specs, Price in India & What It Means for Flagship Smartphones</h1> <p>On 26 November 2025, iQOO officially unveiled the much-anticipated iQOO 15 — a flagship smartphone that aims to combine raw performance, premium hardware and gaming-ready features into one package. In this article, we take you through its full specs, pricing in India, new features, pros and cons, and whether it might be worth upgrading to. Whether you’re a gamer, power user, or simply curious, read on for a deep dive.</p> <h2>Launch date & Pricing in India</h2> <p>The iQOO 15 has been launched in India, with the base 12 GB + 256 GB variant priced at ₹64,999. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} The higher-end 16 GB + 256 GB (or 16 GB + 512 GB) variant steps up further in price. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} Pre-booking campaigns reportedly include benefits such as exchange bonuses, discount offers, and even free earbuds / extended-warranty deals for early buyers. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p> <p>Official sale is expected to begin starting early December, making it one of the first major flagship releases of the last quarter of 2025 in India. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p> <h2>Cutting-Edge Performance: Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 + Q3 Gaming Chip</h2> <p>Under the hood, the iQOO 15 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset — one of the fastest mobile SoCs currently available. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p> <p>But what really sets it apart is iQOO’s proprietary Q3 “Supercomputing” chip, which acts like a dedicated mobile-graphics card for gaming. This chip promises enhanced frame stability, efficient power usage, and support for advanced features like real-time ray tracing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} This makes the iQOO 15 not just a flagship — but a gaming-first flagship, suitable for competitive titles and heavy graphics workloads.</p> <p>RAM and storage options are generous: up to 16 GB LPDDR5x RAM, and UFS 4.1 storage up to 1 TB. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} Combined with Android 16-based OriginOS 6, performance and multitasking are both smooth and future-proof. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</p> <h2>Display: Samsung 2K M14 LEAD OLED — Bright, Big and Fluid</h2> <p>Arguably the most talked-about spec on the iQOO 15 is its display. The phone uses a 6.85-inch Samsung M14 LEAD OLED panel with 2K resolution (3168 × 1440) and 144 Hz refresh rate. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</p> <p>The display represents a leap forward in both brightness and efficiency: iQOO claims up to 2,600 nits in high-brightness mode (HBM), and a local peak brightness of 6,000 nits — ideal for outdoor use on sunny days. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} It also supports rich colour reproduction (P3 gamut), HDR playback, and a high sampling rate (300 Hz touch in gaming mode) which promises ultra-responsive controls for gamers. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</p> <p>In addition, the LEAD OLED technology reportedly improves power efficiency and reduces motion blur, while polarizer-free design enhances brightness and reduces strain under sunlight. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} All this makes the screen one of the best you can get on a phone in 2025 — whether you game, stream, or read.</p> <h2>Camera Setup: Versatile Triple 50 MP System</h2> <p>Camera wise, the iQOO 15 doesn’t disappoint. On the back, it sports a triple 50 MP setup: a primary Sony IMX921 sensor with OIS, a 50 MP periscope telephoto (Sony IMX882) for 3× optical zoom, and a 50 MP ultra-wide lens for broader shots. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} </p> <p>For selfies, there’s a 32 MP front camera. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} The periscope lens gives the iQOO 15 a rare advantage in long-range photography — handy for travel, landscapes, or detail shots without losing sharpness. According to iQOO’s own spec sheet, the periscope camera supports “3× optical zoom, up to 100× zoom” (likely hybrid/digital) for distant subjects. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}</p> <p>Combined with large sensors, OIS stabilisation, and advanced image-processing algorithms (including AI-based enhancements), the iQOO 15 aims to deliver flagship-level photography and video performance — a plus for users who want more than just gaming power in their smartphone.</p> <h2>Battery, Charging & Durability</h2> <p>The iQOO 15 packs a massive 7,000 mAh silicon-anode battery — one of the largest in any 2025 flagship. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} This promises all-day battery life even under heavy use: gaming, video streaming, multitasking, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}</p> <p>Charging support is robust: 100 W wired fast charging, and 40 W wireless charging — a first for iQOO’s flagship lineup. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} That means you can get a full charge in under an hour or so — ideal if you use the phone heavily but still want quick top-ups.</p> <p>For durability, the phone offers IP68 and IP69 ratings for dust and water resistance. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} Build quality includes a flat metal frame, matte finishing for grip, and a “floating” camera module design. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} Overall, this makes the iQOO 15 a rugged, powerful device built for real-world use beyond just tech specs.</p> <h2>Software & Gaming Features</h2> <p>Out of the box, the iQOO 15 runs OriginOS 6 based on Android 16. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} The combination of hardware & software is optimised for gaming — especially with the Q3 gaming chip working alongside Snapdragon. iQOO claims the Q3 chip enables mobile-level ray tracing, super-resolution graphics, smoother frame rates and better thermal efficiency under load. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}</p> <p>Furthermore, the phone uses an 8,000 mm² single-layer vapor-chamber (VC) cooling system — reportedly the largest ever used by iQOO — to efficiently dissipate heat during prolonged gaming sessions. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22} Combined cooling, powerful GPU, and high-touch sampling rate make iQOO 15 a very serious contender for mobile esports and heavy-duty gaming in 2025.</p> <h2>Why iQOO 15 Matters — and Who It’s For</h2> <p>The iQOO 15 doesn’t just raise the bar for iQOO itself — it challenges other flagship phones in 2025 to deliver on multiple fronts: performance, display, battery, camera, and price. For gamers, power users, content creators and heavy multitaskers, it packs nearly everything you could want in a smartphone.</p> <p>Because of its competitive pricing (starting ₹64,999) — lower than many flagship rivals with similar specs — iQOO 15 could offer excellent value. If you care about raw speed, gaming performance, long battery life, a bright high-refresh display, and a capable camera rig, this phone ticks a majority of those boxes.</p> <h2>Potential Downsides & Considerations</h2> <p>Of course, no device is perfect. The iQOO 15 is quite large (6.85-inch display), which might feel bulky for users who prefer compact phones. Also, while periscope zoom gives versatility, high digital zoom levels (e.g. 100×) may suffer from quality degradation — a common limitation in many phones. Users who prioritise ultra-premium photography (e.g. night photography, portrait bokeh) may still find specialised camera-centric rivals more appealing.</p> <p>Moreover, even though the battery is large and fast charging is supported, heavy gaming + high refresh rate + brightness might still drain battery faster. And long-term software support remains to be seen — how many future Android updates iQOO will provide is not yet clear.</p> <h2>Verdict: A Flagship for Gamers and Power Users — At a Lower Price</h2> <p>The iQOO 15 represents a bold statement from iQOO: a flagship that doesn’t compromise. With top-tier performance, a phenomenal OLED display, huge battery, versatile cameras, and a relatively aggressive price, it stands out among 2025 smartphones — especially for those prioritising performance and value.</p> <p>If you’re a gamer, heavy multitasker or someone who wants a “do-everything” phone, the iQOO 15 is one of the best options around. For photography-first users, it might not beat the absolute best camera phones, but for an all-rounder flagship with competitive pricing, it’s very hard to beat.</p> <p>Overall, iQOO 15 proves that in 2025, the flagship smartphone doesn’t have to cost a fortune — if you know where to balance specs, price, and user needs.</p> <p>Have thoughts, questions or want a comparison with competing models (OnePlus, Samsung, etc.)? Let me know — I can also provide a spec-by-spec comparison to help you decide.</p>
